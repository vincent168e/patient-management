# Patient Management System (Backend)

This project demonstrates a patient management system using a Spring Boot-based microservices architecture. It comprises five modules: patient-service, analytics-service, api-gateway, auth-service, and billing-service, built with Spring Boot 3.4.5 and Java 21. The patient-service manages patient data using Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL, organized under src/main/java/com/pm/patientservice with a Patient entity and REST endpoints. The billing-service connects to patient-service via gRPC for synchronous communication, while the analytics-service integrates with patient-service through Kafka for event-driven data processing. The auth-service implements JWT-based authentication, securing API access. The api-gateway routes requests to respective services. Each module includes internal API request handling and integration test scripts for validation. A parent pom.xml manages shared dependencies, and Dockerfiles enable containerization. This modular setup ensures scalable, independent microservices with robust communication and testing.
